          "<p><b><big>Bind Network Address</big></b><br>This  specifies  the  address which the openais executive should bind.  This address should always end in  zero.   If  the  totem traffic  should  be routed over 192.168.5.92, set bindnetaddr to 192.168.5.0.<br>This may also be an IPV6 address, in which case IPV6  networking will  be used.  In this case, the full address must be specified and there is no automatic selection  of  the  network  interface within a specific subnet as with IPv4. If IPv6 networking is used, the nodeid field must be specified.<br></p>\n" +
            "<p><b><big>Multicast Address</big></b><br>This is the multicast address used by  openais  executive.   The default  should work for most networks, but the network administrator should be queried  about  a  multicast  address  to  use.  Avoid 224.x.x.x because this is a \"config\" multicast address.<br>This  may  also be an IPV6 multicast address, in which case IPV6 networking will be used.  If IPv6 networking is used, the nodeid field must be specified.</p>\n" +
            "<p><b><big>Port</big></b><br>This  specifies  the UDP port number.  It is possible to use the same multicast address on a network with  the  openais  services configured for different UDP ports.<br></p>\n" +
            "<p><b><big>Member Address</big></b><br>This list specifies all the nodes in the cluster by IP address. This could be configurable when using udpu(Unicast). <br></p>\n" +
            "<p><b><big>Node ID</big></b><br>This  configuration  option  is  optional  when  using  IPv4 and required when using IPv6.  This is a 32 bit value specifying the node identifier delivered to the cluster membership service.  If this is not specified with IPv4, the node id will be  determined from  the  32  bit  IP address the system to which the system is bound with ring identifier of 0.  The node identifier  value  of zero is reserved and should not be used.<br></p>\n" +
            "<p><b><big>rrp_mode</big></b><br>This specifies the mode of redundant ring, which  may  be  none, active,  or  passive.   Active replication offers slightly lower latency from transmit to delivery in faulty network environments but  with less performance.  Passive replication may nearly double the speed of the totem  protocol  if  the  protocol  doesn't become  cpu bound.  The final option is none, in which case only one network interface will be used to operate the  totem  protocol.  If  only one interface directive is specified, none is automatically chosen.  If multiple interface directives  are  specified, only active or passive may be chosen.<br></p>\n" +
            "<p><b><big>Cluster Name</big></b><br>This specifies the name of cluster and it's used for automatic generating of multicast address. Default is hacluster. For a geo cluster, each cluster must have a unique name.<br></p>\n" +
            "<p><b><big>Expected votes</big></b><br>Expect vote number for voting quorum.  Will be automatically calculated when the nodelist {} section is present in corosync.conf (the list will be generated when using unicast transport) or can be specified in the quorum {} section (Expect votes should use the total node numble of the cluster). If Expected votes presents in unicast transport, the value will override the one automatically calculated.<br></p>\n" +

          "<p><b><big>Model</big></b><br>Specifies the model to be used. This parameter is required.  corosync-qdevice is modular and is able to support multiple different models. The model basically defines what type of arbitrator is used. Currently only 'net' is supported.</p>\n" +
            "<p><b><big>Votes</big></b><br>The number of votes provided to the cluster by qdevice. It should be configured as 1 when using 'ffsplit' algorithm and sum(votes_per_node) - 1 when 'lms' algorithm. Default is 1 or (number_of_nodes - 1) or generally sum(votes_per_node) - 1 based on algorithm.</p>\n" +
            "<p><b><big>Host</big></b><br>Specifies the IP address or host name of the qnetd server to be used. This parameter is required.</p>\n" +
            "<p><b><big>Port</big></b><br>Specifies TCP port of qnetd server. Default is 5403.</p>\n" +
            "<p><b><big>TLS</big></b><br>Can be one of 'on', 'off' or 'required' and specifies if tls should be used. 'on' means a connection with TLS is attempted first, but if the server doesn't advertise TLS support then non-TLS will be used. 'off' is used then TLS is not required and it's then not even tried. This mode is the only one which doesn't need a properly initialized NSS database. 'required' means TLS is required and if the server doesn't support TLS, qdevice will exit with error message. 'on' need manually change, refer to corosync-qdevice's man page for more details. Default is 'off' in yast.</p>\n" +
            "<p><b><big>Algorithm</big></b><br>Decision algorithm. Can be one of the 'ffsplit' or 'lms'.  (Actually there are also 'test' and '2nodelms', both of which are mainly for developers and shouldn't be used for production clusters, so yast will convert to 'ffsplit' automatically). For a description of what each algorithm means and how the algorithms differ see their individual sections.  Default value is ffsplit.</p>\n" +
            "<p><b><big>Tie breaker</big></b><br>Can be one of 'lowest', 'highest' or 'valid_node_id' (number) values. It's used as a fallback if qdevice has to decide between two or more equal partitions. 'lowest' means the partition with the lowest node id is chosen. 'highest' means the partition with highest node id is chosen. And 'valid_node_id' means that the partition containing the node with the given node id is chosen. Default is 'lowest'.</p>\n"

It further specifies that  all  data should  be  encrypted  with the sober128 encryption algorithm to protect data from eavesdropping.  Enabling this option adds a 36 byte header to every message sent by totem which reduces total throughput.  Encryption and authentication consume 75% of CPU cycles in aisexec as  measured  with gprof when enabled.  For  100Mbit  networks  with  1500  MTU  frame  transmissions: A throughput of 9Mb/s is possible with 100% cpu utilization when this  option  is enabled on 3GHz cpus.  A throughput of 10Mb/s is possible wth 20% cpu utilization when this option is  disabled on 3GHz cpus.  For  gig-e networks with large frame transmissions: A throughput of 20Mb/s is possible when this  option  is  enabled  on  3GHz cpus.   A throughput of 60Mb/s is possible when this option is disabled on 3GHz cpus.  The default is on. <br></p>\n"
